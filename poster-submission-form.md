## Title

Celebrating 7 years of The BinderHub Federation

## Abstract

The BinderHub Federation operates mybinder.org, a 1-click solution to share scientific notebook in a sandbox that the recipient can immediately interact using a web browser. The BinderHub Federation has served millions of researchers for 7 years now! Many workshops and presentations were improved thanks to attendees have access to mybinder.org. The BinderHub Federation is an experiment in running open source infrastructure as a public good by researchers to researchers. Sustainability challenges faced by open source software production are magnified here - we need people time to manage the infrastructure, pay for computational infrastructure required to run the service, operate it reliably by responding to outages in a timely fashion, and fight off abuse from malicious actors. This posters covers the lessons learnt over this 7 years at GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, one member of the federation.

## Prerequisites

Use of mybinder.org requires knowledge of how to use a web browser to gain access to the provided integrated development environment (IDE), for example Jupyter Lab or R Studio. Knowledge of Jupyter Lab or R Studio is recommended to interact with the scientific notebook. Knowledge of Kubernetes is required to engage in discussion regarding the technical details of the infrastructure behind mybinder.org. 

## Outcomes

Attendees will be more informed of the cost to run mybinder.org and ways to contribute to it long term sustainability as a community led project.
