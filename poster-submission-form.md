## Title

Celebrating 7 years of The BinderHub Federation

## Abstract

The idea of Binder was first introduced in 2015 as a means of sharing and reproducing computational work. Since then, the Binder project has evolved into a widely used, production-grade service. The mybinder.org platform enables millions of users each year to launch interactive, shareable scientific notebooks with a single clickâ€”requiring nothing more than a web browser.

To meet this growing demand and ensure long-term sustainability, the project matured about seven years ago into the BinderHub Federation, an international collaboration of institutions that collectively operate the infrastructure behind mybinder.org.

This poster offers a behind-the-scenes look at GESIS's role as one of the federation members, highlighting the operational challenges and collaborative principles that underpin the project. We discuss how the BinderHub Federation represents a unique model of open-source infrastructure as a public good that is developed and maintained by researchers, for researchers.

Special attention is also given to the role of the open-source software BinderHub within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI, NFDI4DS, and Jupyter4NFDI), where it enables reproducibility, accessibility, and the democratization of open computational research practices. Finally, through this lens, we reflect on the broader significance of community-driven infrastructure in modern research software engineering.

## Prerequisites

Use of mybinder.org requires knowledge of how to use a web browser to gain access to the provided integrated development environment (IDE), for example Jupyter Lab or R Studio. Knowledge of Jupyter Lab or R Studio is recommended to interact with the scientific notebook. Knowledge of Kubernetes is required to engage in discussion regarding the technical details of the infrastructure behind mybinder.org. 

## Outcomes

Attendees will learn about mybinder.org, about the use of the of the open-source software BinderHub within the context of the German NFDI, and about ways to contribute to the long term sustainability of mybinder.org as a community led project.
