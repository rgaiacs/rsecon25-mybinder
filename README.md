# mybinder.org poster for RSECon25

The [`poster-submission-form.md`](poster-submission-form.md) was submitted to [RSECon25](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/).

This is based on the work in earlier 2025, for example

- [Add a 2i2c federation member on Hetzner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/3169)
- [Configure new GESIS Server at Hetzner Online GmbH](https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/3265)

And this has some intersection with a [proposal](https://hackmd.io/deibMe_-TkqnPhoWEg5UoQ) to [SciPy2025](https://www.scipy2025.scipy.org/).
